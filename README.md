# SLR parser (University project)

### What is it? 

SLR parser is a variant of LR parser.

LR (Left-to-right, Rightmost derivation in reverse) parsers are a type of bottom-up parser that analyse deterministic context-free languages in linear time. LR parsers can be generated by a parser generator from a formal grammar defining the syntax of the language to be parsed. They are widely used for the processing of computer languages. LR parsers are deterministic; they produce a single correct parse without guesswork or backtracking, in linear time.

An LR parser scans and parses the input text in one forward pass over the text. The parser builds up the parse tree incrementally, bottom up, and left to right, without guessing or backtracking. At every point in this pass, the parser has accumulated a list of subtrees or phrases of the input text that have been already parsed. Those subtrees are not yet joined together because the parser has not yet reached the right end of the syntax pattern that will combine them.

### Realization details

This parser written in Python is aimed to parse math expressions.
